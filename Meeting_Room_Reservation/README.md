# scala-play-starter
A basic setup for a Scala Play Framework project featuring Slick integration and CRUD operations for a `Person` model.

This repository provides a foundational project to help you get started with Scala and Play Framework, including:

- Slick for type-safe database interaction.
- CRUD operations for managing Person entities, demonstrating JSON serialization/deserialization, custom readers, and default values handling.

Use this as a starter template to quickly build and expand Play applications with database-backed models and robust JSON support.
